		</h1>
		<p class="split">The Church of St. Swithuns, Headbourne Worthy, is set within a small woodland area next to a small river coming from Hyde Bourne. Built in early 10th-11th century in commemoration St. Swithun, a Bishop of Winchester who died in 862AD, this Saxon church is a building of substantial architectural importance. The church of St Swithun is located on the Pilgrim's way which is a historic route between Winchester Cathedral and the shrine of Thomas Beckett in Canterbury, Kent. The Saxon masonry to build this church is of limestone quarried at Binstead on the Isle of Wight. The sturdy S.W Tower, topped by a wooden belfry, was built in the 13th Century as was the south wall of the nave and the channel extension.</p>
