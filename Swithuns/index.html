			<h1>History</h1>
			<h2>Rich and important</h2>
			<p>The Church of St. Swithuns, Headbourne Worthy, is set within a small woodland area next to a small river coming from Hyde Bourne. Built in early 10th-11th century in commemoration St. Swithun, a Bishop of Winchester who died in 862AD, this Saxon church is a building of substantial architectural importance. The church of St Swithun is located on the Pilgrim's way which is a historic route between Winchester Cathedral and the shrine of Thomas Beckett in Canterbury, Kent. </p>

			<p>The Saxon masonry to build this church is of limestone quarried at Binstead on the Isle of Wight. The sturdy S.W Tower, topped by a wooden belfry, was built in the 13th Century as was the south wall of the nave and the channel extension. Leading into the 19th Century, the church went under a lot of restoration including part of the chancel to accommodate the new organ. Above the door of the vestry is the 11th century carved in stone which was originally the outer western wall that represents Christ, flanked by Mary and St. John with the hand of god above. </p>

			<p>More recently in 1998, a £100,000 was raised to restore and ring the ancient bells, to build a stairway to a newly constructed bell-chamber. The money was also used to create a new gallery across the west end of the nave.  Inside the base of the tower a toilet and kitchenette was built. In addition to these, new lighting and heating was added to modernise the church slightly. In 1999, the Helle organ within the church that had been created circa 1850 with its hand painted pipes was repaired and renovated.</p>
