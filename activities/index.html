		<h1>Activities</h1>
		<h2>All ages</h2>
		<p>Here at St. Mary's in Kings Worthy. We hold many activities for our congregation on a weekly basis. They cater to all ages from the young people within the community to the older people. We regularly hold a Holy Communion on Sunday's in addition to other events throughout the week. To view the full list of activities we do click here. In addition to this, we also hold a large number of clubs catered towards the younger people of the congregation such as Little Fishes, H2O and XStream. Each of these clubs cater to a different age as our congregation is so different.</p>
